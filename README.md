# SSM
This repisotry has been deveoped as a case study of industrial soft sensor model

# Data Avaibilty
The data is not avalilabe but the codes are available and it could be easily adopeted following the framework presented in the paper

# Python Script
python script is named SSM.ipynb which is defined for different machine learing methods for Brix index prediction including:
- Pair Plot
- Correlation Matrix
- Autocorrelation
- LSTM for basic model
- LSTM for model 1
- LSTM for model 2
- MLR
- GRNN
- SVR
- DTR

# Additional Information
- For more details on the process description and soft sensor, refer to the SSM article.
- For any questions or issues, please contact seso@kt.dtu.dk or morebo@kt.dtu.dk.
Thank you for using the SSM repository.
