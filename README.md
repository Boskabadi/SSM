# Soft Sensor Model (SSM)

This repository contains machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models developed for predicting the Brix index using sensor data, including steam pressure, vacuum pressure, level, and time-series features. The repository consists of two Jupyter notebooks:

SSS_ML.ipynb: Implements various ML models for different input configurations.
SSM_DL.ipynb: Implements various DL architectures for more complex time-series data.
Project Overview
The goal is to accurately predict the Brix index using different combinations of sensor inputs across multiple models. The models are categorized into three configurations:

Model                        Type	ML Inputs	DL Inputs	Output
- Basic Model	Steam pressure,     Level	Steam pressure,     Level,  Time-series	Brix index
Â´  Model 1	Vacuum pressure, Steam pressure, Level	Vacuum pressure, Steam pressure, Level, Time-series	Brix index
- Model 2 (Chosen)	Vacuum pressure, Steam pressure	Vacuum pressure, Steam pressure, Time-series	Brix index
